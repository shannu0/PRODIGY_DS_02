Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis are fundamental steps in any data science project. This process involves transforming raw data into a clean, organized, and understandable format, and then exploring the data to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies.

Data Cleaning

The initial phase focuses on identifying and rectifying data inconsistencies and errors. Key steps include:

Handling missing values: Identifying columns with missing values and applying appropriate imputation techniques (e.g., mean, median, mode imputation, or more sophisticated methods like K-Nearest Neighbors).
Detecting and handling outliers: Identifying unusual data points that deviate significantly from the overall pattern and deciding on appropriate actions (removal, capping, or further investigation).
Data type conversions: Ensuring data types are correct (e.g., converting categorical data to numerical for modeling purposes).
Error correction: Identifying and correcting inconsistencies or errors in the data (e.g., typos, incorrect date formats).
Data standardization: Transforming data to a common scale (e.g., normalization, standardization) for modeling purposes.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Once the data is cleaned, EDA involves exploring the data to discover patterns, relationships, and anomalies. Common EDA techniques include:

Summary statistics: Calculating measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and quartiles to understand data distribution.
Visualization: Creating plots like histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and correlation matrices to visualize data relationships.
Data profiling: Analyzing data characteristics such as data types, missing values, and unique values.
Feature engineering: Creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
Hypothesis testing: Formulating and testing hypotheses about the data.
Example: Titanic Dataset

When working with the Titanic dataset, common data cleaning steps include handling missing values in age, cabin, and embarked columns, converting categorical variables like sex and embarked to numerical format, and potentially creating new features like family size or passenger title.

EDA on the Titanic dataset might involve:

Analyzing survival rates based on passenger class, sex, age, and other factors.
Visualizing the distribution of age, fare, and other numerical variables.
Exploring relationships between variables using scatter plots and correlation matrices.
Identifying potential outliers or anomalies in the data.
By effectively performing data cleaning and EDA, data scientists can gain valuable insights into the dataset, uncover hidden patterns, and prepare the data for further analysis or modeling.
